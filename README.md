# sinit
`sinit` is a project initiation tool that creates code projects in a style I personally like. This is only intended to automate common work patterns for me personally, but if you get use out it, too, awesome! It is written in Go, because I wanted to learn Go.

# use
```shell
sinit <project-name> <stack>
```
