# sinit
`sinit` is a project initiation tool that creates code projects in a style I personally like. This is only intended to automate common work patterns for me personally, but if you get use out it, too, awesome! It is written in Go, because I wanted to learn Go.

# use
```
Usage of sinit:
  -n -name string
    	The name of your new project (default "new-project")
  -s -stack string
    	The project stack you want to create. e.g. node (default "node")
```
